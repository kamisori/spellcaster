Processing code to implement John Fairfield's Spellcaster

Processing is a visually-oriented Java-based language developed by 
Casey Reas and Ben Fry. It is open source and available from processing.org.

Spellcaster was originally developed on Apple 2e by John Fairfield in 1984, 
and ported to Commodore 64 by Scott Gilkeson. It was published with a tutorial 
and a book to get you started casting spells.

Spellcaster starts with a dot in the middle of the screen. Each letter key is a 
command that acts on that dot--to move it one step, change the direction,
change the color, or change the location (teleport). You can test whether the
color you are stepping onto matches the current pen color, and branch based
on the result. You can name a series of commands (create a spell) which you
can then cast and include in other spells.
